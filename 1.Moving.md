## Basic movement
To move around in a buffer, you can use the following keys: H, J, K and L, to move to Left, Down, Up and Right, respectively.
You can use the arrow keys, but, you will get used to HJKL :)

### Moving to top/bottom of the buffer/file
`gg` : Go to the top of the file

`<Shift + g` : Go to the bottom of the file

### Go to line
`<line_number> + Shift + g` or `<line_number> + gg`

To go to line 3, for example: `3 + Shift + g` or `3 + gg`

### Moving horizontally
`w` : go to the beginning of the next word

`b` : go back to the beginning of the previous word

`<Shift + w>` : go to the beggining of the next word, but, in this case, Vim/Neovim will consider only spaces as the boundaries of the word (ignoring `,.` etc)

`<Shift + b>` : go back to the beggining of the previous word, considering only spaces as the bounderies of the word

`0` : go to the start of the line

`<Shift + 6>` : go to the first non-white character of the line

`<Shift + 4>` : go to the end of the line
